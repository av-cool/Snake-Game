# Snake-Game
Processing  
It is a classic snake game built from p5.js library and Processing IDE.  
Motivation : To build an AI to the game to make it a perfect Snake Game. Perfect is a relative term. Perfect means the game ends only when there is no room to grow for the snake.

## Rules And Instructions
#1 Moves : Left - Right - Up - Down(using Arrow Keys)  
#2 Snake can only die by hitting the walls or itself.  
#3 Currently the world's topology is a Torus.  
The left wall is connected to the right wall and the top wall is connected to the bottom.  
(see wikipedia - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus_interconnect)  
#4 world is a 600x600 pixels and the snake is 10 pixels wide.  

## How to run the code and play
#1 Clone the code or download it. Open the snake game file in Processing IDE. Aavailable in www.processing.org. Hit on run and enjoy.  
#2 Also can use the p5 online editor. just google it. Copy all the .js files and hit the run button.  

## Future Work
Here is the interesting part. To build an AI for the snake to nail the game. Algorithms that are currently under consideration.  
  A-Star  
  Hamiltonian Cycle. (This is the winner)  
  Q-learning.
